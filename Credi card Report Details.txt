I am excited to share a recent project I completed on Credit Card Transaction and Customer report using Power BI.
𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞: To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.
𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 (𝐂𝐒𝐕): Import data to SQL database
Prepare csv file
Create tables in SQL
import csv file into SQL

𝐃𝐀𝐗 𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐫𝐲 :

> AgeGroup = SWITCH( TRUE(), 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30", 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 30 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40, "30-40", 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 40 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50, "40-50", 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60", 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60, "60+", "unknown" )

> IncomeGroup = SWITCH( TRUE(), 'public cust_detail'[income] < 35000, "Low", 'public cust_detail'[income] >= 35000 && 'public cust_detail'[income] <70000, "Med", 'public cust_detail'[income] >= 70000, "High", "unknown" )

> week_num2 = WEEKNUM('public cc_detail'[week_start_date]) Revenue = 'public cc_detail'[annual_fees] + 'public cc_detail'[total_trans_amt] + 'public cc_detail'[interest_earned]

> Current_week_Reveneue = CALCULATE( SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]), FILTER( ALL('public cc_detail'), 'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2]))) 

> Previous_week_Reveneue = CALCULATE( SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]), FILTER( ALL('public cc_detail'), 'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])-1)

𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:
Sum of revenue by card category : The blue card generated the highest revenue of almost 46 million.
Sum of revenue by education type : The revenue generated from the graduated is highest which is of 22 million.
Sum of revenue by job type : The highest revenue generated is from the businessman which is of 17 million.
Sum of interest earn : The total interest earned Is of rupees 78,43,382.
Sum of revenue earned is 55 Million.
Sum of interest earned is 8 Million.
So, this was the short over view of the data , also the data is analysed with the Quarter section that is Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4.
